# Project_TheEntity
 A group of players go through doom levels while being pursued by an omnipotent entity.
 THIS IS A MULTIPLAYER MOD AND CURRENTLY DOESN'T HAVE A SINGLEPLAYER OPTION.
 I do have plans for a singleplayer campaign.
 
 Please set the CVARs and check the controls to set the game up properly.
 Recommended to set 'teamdamage 1' and 'sv_nocoopinfo 1' for the game to be played as intended.
 Teamdamage is the only way for game to players to have an actively opposing player while the survivors spawn at the COOP spawn locations.
 
 CURRENT FEATURES:
 
 - SURVIVORS
 -- Use flashlights that can be toggled

 - THE ENTITY
 -- Can go invisible and noclip
 -- Is able to turn on and off nightvision
 -- Can kill things with ease
 -- Cannot be killed (can't kill itself either)
 -- Ability to flash their perspective to all survivors
 -- Can spawn monsters
 
 BUGS:
 -
 - More than one ENTITY will break the stalker view ability
 - Players with higher ping will experience flickering with the flashlight
